# Introduction
In this repository, you can find a MATLAB-based simulator application for the Micromouse competition, along with presentations covering both software and hardware aspects related to the competition. Additionally, there's a tutorial explaining how to use the application effectively.

# Features
The simulator for the Micromouse competition includes features such as solving algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*), tracking metrics (score, exploration time, path completion time), customizable micromouse parameters (speed, acceleration, deceleration, turn velocity), full maze preview, mouse POV perspectives, pause functionality, strategic wall-breaking for path optimization, and flexibility in choosing start/destination points and enabling/disabling diagonal path animations during solving.

# Steps

After downloading "Maze_Solver_Simulator" Open "InterfaceMazeSolver_FASTEST_PATH.m"

  1-Click on "Load" and choose a PNG maze image.
  
  2-Choose the resolution of the maze (larger resolution for bigger mazes).
  
  3-Customize parameters such as animation, diagonal path, micromouse speed, velocity, etc.
  
  4-Select an algorithm (BFS, DFS, A*) or choose the fastest path option.
  
  5-Choose the starting point and ending point within the maze.
